# Netdata Agent Web GUI

## Generating dashboard.js

The monolithic `dashboards.js` file is automatically generated by concatenating the source files located in the `web/gui/src/dashboard.js/` directory by running the build script:

```sh
cd web/gui
make
```

After every change in the `src` directory, the `dashboard.js` file should be regenerated and commited to the repository.
