# Get started with Netdata

Netdata is an free and open-source (FOSS) monitoring agent that collects thousands of hardware and software metrics from
any physical or virtual system (we call them _nodes_) and organizes them in an easy-to-use and -navigate interface.

Together with [Netdata Cloud](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/cloud), you can monitor your entire infrastructure in
real time and troubleshoot problems that threaten the health of your nodes before they occur.

Netdata runs permanently on all your physical/virtual servers, containers, cloud deployments, and edge/IoT devices. It
runs on Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, and more), container/microservice platforms (Kubernetes clusters,
Docker), and many other operating systems (FreeBSD, macOS), with no `sudo` required.

## Install on Linux with one-line installer (recommended)

The **recommended** way to install Netdata on a Linux node (physical, virtual, container, IoT) is our one-line
[kickstart script](/packaging/installer/methods/kickstart.md). This script automatically installs dependencies and
builds Netdata from its source code.

Copy the script, paste it into your node's terminal, and hit `Enter` to begin the installation process.

<OneLineInstall />

Next, [open and explore the dashboard](#open-and-explore-the-dashboard).

## Run Netdata with Docker

You can also try out Netdata's capabilities in a [Docker container](/packaging/docker/README.md). Copy the following
`docker run` command into your node and hit `Enter` to download and run the container.

```bash
docker run -d --name=netdata \
  -p 19999:19999 \
  -v netdataconfig:/etc/netdata \
  -v netdatalib:/var/lib/netdata \
  -v netdatacache:/var/cache/netdata \
  -v /etc/passwd:/host/etc/passwd:ro \
  -v /etc/group:/host/etc/group:ro \
  -v /proc:/host/proc:ro \
  -v /sys:/host/sys:ro \
  -v /etc/os-release:/host/etc/os-release:ro \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --cap-add SYS_PTRACE \
  --security-opt apparmor=unconfined \
  netdata/netdata
```

Next, [open and explore the dashboard](#open-and-explore-the-dashboard).

## Open and explore the dashboard

To start using Netdata, open a browser and navigate to `http://NODE:19999`, replacing `NODE` with either `localhost` or
the hostname/IP address of a remote node.

![Animated GIF of navigating to the
dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/80825153-abaec600-8b94-11ea-8b17-1b770a2abaa9.gif)

Netdata's dashboard is a single page with hundreds of preconfigured charts and thousands of metrics that update every
second. Everything you see is autodetected and organized with zero configuration required.

To see more charts, scroll down or use the **menu** on the right-hand side of the dashboard to navigate between
**sections**, which are groups of closely related charts.

![Animated GIF of using the menus and
submenus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/80832425-7c528600-8ba1-11ea-8140-d0a17a62009b.gif)

## Interact with charts

Every chart in the Netdata dashboard is fully interactive, and Netdata synchronizes your interactions to help you
understand exactly how a node behaved in any timeframe, whether that's seconds or days.

![Animated GIF of the standard Netdata dashboard being manipulated and synchronizing
charts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/80839230-b034a800-8baf-11ea-9cb2-99c1e10f0f85.gif)

Let's cover two of the most important ways to interact with charts: panning through time and zooming.

To pan through time, **click and hold** (or touch and hold) on any chart, then **drag your mouse** (or finger) to the
left or right. Dragging to the right pans backward through time, while dragging to the left pans forward in time. Think
of it like pushing the current timeframe off the screen so you can see what came before or after.

To zoom, press and hold `Shift`, then use your mouse's scroll wheel, or a two-finger pinch if you're using a touchpad.

## What's next?

You've now installed Netdata, visited the dashboard at `http://NODE:19999`, learned the basics of getting around, and
learned how to interact with charts by zooming and panning through time.

Where you go from here is based on your use case, immediate needs, and experience with monitoring and troubleshooting.

### Configuration

Discover the recommended way to [configure Netdata's settings or behavior](/docs/configure/nodes.md) using our built-in
`edit-config` script, then apply that knowledge to mission-critical tweaks, such as [changing how long Netdata stores
metrics](/docs/store/change-metrics-storage.md).

### Dashboard

Learn even more about [navigating Netdata's dashboard and interacting with
charts](/docs/visualize/interact-dashboards-charts.md).

### Data collection

If Netdata didn't autodetect all the hardware, containers, services, or applications running on your node, you should
learn more about [how data collectors work](/docs/collect/how-collectors-work.md). If there's a [supported
collector](/collectors/COLLECTORS.md) for metrics you need, [configure the collector](/docs/collect/enable-configure.md)
or read about its requirements to configure your endpoint to publish metrics in the correct format and endpoint.

### Alarms & notifications

Netdata comes with hundreds of preconfigured alarms, designed by our monitoring gurus in parallel with our open-source
community, but you may want to [edit alarms](/docs/monitor/configure-alarms.md) or [enable
notifications](/docs/monitor/enable-notifications.md) to customize your Netdata experience.

### Need to monitor multiple nodes in one place?

For robust multi-node monitoring from a single interface, consider [Netdata
Cloud](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/cloud), which streams, aggregates, and visualizes metrics from any number of
nodes. It's all the same out-of-the-box, zero-configuration functionality of the open-source monitoring agent, but for
any number of distributed nodes, _entirely for free_.

There is an alternative for those who aren't interested in using Netdata Cloud, albeit with some required configuration.
Each node can [stream](/streaming/README.md) its metrics to any other node, and the default
[registry](/registry/README.md) is configurable to create a private "network" of Netdata dashboards.
